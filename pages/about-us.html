					Our History
				</h2>
				<p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
					Advantage Family Outreach & Foster Care was founded with a simple yet
					profound goal: to create environments that empower children to grow,
					heal, and thrive. What started as a small team of passionate social
					workers has grown into a leading private foster care agency licensed
					through the Ohio Department of Youth Services. We are proud of our
					history and the hundreds of families we have supported on their
					journey.

					Our Approach
				</h2>
				<p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
					We believe that every child deserves a chance to succeed. Our approach
					is built on a foundation of teamwork, compassion, and unwavering
					support. We work closely with our foster parents, providing them with
					comprehensive training and 24/7 access to our experienced team. This
					collaborative model ensures that both children and foster families
					receive the resources they need to navigate the challenges and joys of
					foster care.
