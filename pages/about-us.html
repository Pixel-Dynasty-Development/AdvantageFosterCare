			<p>
				Advantage Family Outreach & Foster Care is a private foster care
				agency licensed through the Ohio Department of Youth Services. For
				over 15 years, we have been dedicated to our mission of building
				brighter futures for children by providing safe, stable, and
				nurturing homes. We believe every child deserves the opportunity to
				grow, heal, and thrive in an environment that empowers them to reach
				their full potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our organization was founded on the principle that fostering is more
				than just a serviceâ€”it's a community. We work tirelessly to support
				our foster families with comprehensive training, ongoing resources,
				and 24/7 access to our dedicated team. Our programs are designed to
				meet a wide range of needs, from traditional foster care to
				specialized therapeutic and sibling group placements.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Advantage, we are committed to making a difference, one child and
				one family at a time. We are proud of the strong relationships we
				build and the positive impact we have on the lives of children in
				our community. Join us in our journey to provide hope and a new
				beginning for a child in need.

				To create a world where every child experiences the love, stability,

				where families are equipped with everything they need to make a
				profound difference.
